<h4><b>General Conditions of this Rental Agreement</b></h4>

<h5><b>TERM</b></h5>
<p>This Agreement shall commence on the date the products (more fully set out in the Schedule) ( “Product(s)”) are delivered to the Customer
 and remain in full force and effect until the fixed period [equivalent to the tenure of the contract that is agreed by the Customer while booking
 the Product(s)] expires and the Products is returned to Rentomojo, unless terminated earlier or extended pursuant to the flexi tenure policy. </p>
 
<h5><b>FLEXI TENURE POLICY</b></h5>	
<p>Rentomojo provides its Customers, an option to opt for flexible tenure ( “Flexi Tenure”) for early closure and/or extension of the term of 
the Agreement. In case of early closure, the Customer can request for closing the order by informing Rentomojo, 2 (two) weeks prior to the closure
 date. Rentomojo provides its Customer with different monthly rental rates depending on the tenure of the Agreement at the time of order placement.
 In the event of early closure, the difference in monthly rental amount shall be calculated as per the monthly rental rates between Agreement tenure (the tenure selected at order placement) and Actual tenure served (effective tenure at early closure) will have to be paid.

For extension of the term beyond the Agreement tenure by the Customer, the monthly rate applicable at the time of extension shall be followed for calculation of rental amount for the extension period. Any extension or early closure shall be done only through the Rentomojo website and such extension or early closure shall be deemed to be pursuant to this Agreement. Rentomojo reserves the right to revise the rental rates any time at its sole discretion.</p>
        
<h5><b>PAYMENT POLICY</b></h5>        
<p>The invoice shall be raised by Rentomojo on the 1st day of every month and the due date for payment shall be the 10th day of the month ( “Due Date”). Customer shall pay the rental charge as per the invoice raised and mailed to the Customer’s registered e-mail address. Payment made beyond the Due Date shall incur a late fee. Late fees shall be levied on the rental due amount only. The late fees shall be applied three times each month; 10% on the 11th day of the month, another 5% on the 18th day of the month and another 5% on 25th day of the month, the late fees shall be applied only on the pending amount. In case the Products are delivered any time during the month, the first month shall be calculated on a pro-rata basis from the date of delivery until the last day of the first month.

Rentomojo reserves the right to share information with credit rating agencies pursuant to Clause 15 of this Agreement. The Customer hereby agrees that non- payment of rental dues, late fees, asset value leased and any other non-payment, may affect the credit rating of the Customer and Rentomojo shall not be liable for any claim from the Customer for sharing such information with credit rating agencies.</p>       
       
<h5><b>SECURITY DEPOSIT</b></h5>        
<p>In addition to the monthly rental, the Customer shall pay a refundable security deposit ( “Security Deposit”). The Security Deposit shall not carry any interest for the entire tenure. The Security Deposit shall be refunded to the Customer on the termination and after taking delivery of all the Products from the possession of the Customer. Once the final quality check is performed on all the Products, and in case no damage is found, the Security Deposit shall be refunded within 15-21 working days to the Customer. Rentomojo shall refund the Security Deposit to the account from which initial the Security Deposit was paid by the Customer, in case the Customer wishes to get the refund to any other account, the Customer shall provide the details of the account to Rentomojo via e-mail from the registered e-mail address of the Customer and/or upload the account details on the dashboard available on the Rentomojo website, prior to the pick up of the Products.

The Security Deposit shall not include any monthly rental. The Customer cannot request for the monthly invoice dues to be adjusted from the Security Deposit. </p>      

<h5><b>ORDER CONFIRMATION</b></h5>       
<p>On receipt of the order and the Security Deposit, Rentomojo shall confirm the order with the Customer by sending a confirmation to the registered e-mail address of the Customer.
